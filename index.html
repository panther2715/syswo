The purpose of the visit was to understand the challenges faced by children living in difficult conditions, particularly in education.

                    During a discussion with the organization's director, Omega Mlay, the children expressed that their major challenges include a lack of school supplies such as books, notebooks, pens, pencils, school uniforms, and shoes. They also mentioned that food shortages are among the challenges that discourage them from enjoying their studies and performing well in school.
                    
                    The SYWSO director promised to return and provide assistance to the children and called on various stakeholders to come forward and help so that the children can receive quality education and maintain good health in order to achieve their dreams.

The Director of the Smile Youth and Women Support Organization (SYWSO), in collaboration with MAIPAC, has visited the Hadzabe community in Karatu District, Arusha Region. The aim of the visit was to gather traditional knowledge used by this community in environmental conservation and to identify various challenges faced by the women and children of this community.

In addition to collecting traditional knowledge, SYWSO identified major challenges faced by the Hadzabe women and children. These include the lack of nearby schools, which prevents the community’s children from receiving an education, and the absence of a health center, which makes childbirth difficult for women as many of the traditional birth attendants are either elderly or have passed away.

Furthermore, the women of the community have appealed to the government and various stakeholders to help establish schools and a health center in their area to facilitate access to these services and save lives. They also mentioned that another significant challenge is the lack of water for drinking and other uses

                    Smile Youth And Women Support is an organization formed to empower Children and
                    Womens in marginalised communities because they have suffered from historical
                    injustices,lack of education, dispossession of their lands, territories, and
                    resources, this
                    preventing them from exercising, in particular, their rights to development in
                    accordance
                    with their own needs and interest.
                    Smile Youth Women Supports recognizes the urgent need to respect and promote the
                    inherent rights of marginalised communities that derive from their economic and social
                    structures and their cultures, spiritual traditions, histories, and philosophies
                    especially
                    their rights to their lands, territories, and resources
