 The Smile Youth and Women Support Organization visited Longido District and provided education to pastoral communities from various villages about the harmful effects of female genital mutilation (FGM).

During the visit, they encouraged the community to strongly condemn FGM practices and report anyone planning to perform such procedures.

The education involved girls who had been subjected to FGM, the circumcisers who performed the procedures, village government leaders, and traditional leaders (Laigwanani). The goal was to raise awareness, change attitudes, and strengthen efforts to combat FGM in the community.



about 


Many children with physical disabilities  for them and others being stigmatized. 


Some of the children's parents, talking to the leaders of the Smile youth and women support organization who went to give them supports,  explained that despite their children asked to go school, they have been locking them in their homes, so they asked various philanthropists to come forward to help them. 

They have said that they need to be helped with bicycles for the disabled,(whealchair)  clothes, scholarships and schools to have a good infrastucture for children with disabilities.


The Smile  Youth and Women Supports Organization (SYWSO ) Director  Mrs. Omega Mlay, despite expressing his dismay at the condition of children with physical disabilities in the ward, asked parents to give their children a chance to get an education so that it would help them in their lives.

Omega has promised to help children with disabilities by looking for various philanthropists and friends in the country and abroad so that the children can get an education like other children.

"Also l will be  looking for funds that will enable us to provide capacity bulding for community in this District against stigmatization and violence against children with disabilities"
